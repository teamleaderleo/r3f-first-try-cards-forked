Note 4: 
Preventing nudges on drag prevents a double-teleport, but there's still a default teleport; a little flourish. I dislike this.

Note 3:
Adding a hacky nudge can prevent getting stuck at the edges.

Note 2:

Moving pages >= 6.001 or 3 allows for bidirectional infinite scroll... but only when you aren't sat at a perfect edge.

Note 1:
Started the initial commit by changing the cursor to the default. I.e., no overriding the arrow. 

Anyway, I really like this layout. I wanna tweak it, tho.
